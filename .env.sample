# L1 Holesky RPC endpoints (you will need an RPC provider such as BlockPi, or run a full Holesky node yourself)
# If you are using a local Holesky L1 node, you can refer to it as "http://host.docker.internal:8545" and "ws://host.docker.internal:8546", which refer to the default ports in the .env for an eth-docker L1 node.
# However, you may need to add this host to docker-compose.yml. If that does not work, you can try the private local ip address (e.g. http://192.168.1.15:8545). You can find that with `ip addr show` or a similar command.
